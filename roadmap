what do I want:
  - call youtube-dl to download audio file to temporary folder
  - call mpc to add file to MPD
  (must this be inside MPD dir? if yes: config must include MPD dir, and mpc must update db first --> slower)
  - clean up after song was finished (better: removed from playlist)



find out: extension to use files not in library?
are there MPD hooks after deleting playlist that one could use?
